* I created a database and tables with PostgreSQL. I then imported the CSV files and performed various queries for analyisis (See Below)
* I developed a Tableau dashboard [Linked Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/OlympicGames120Years/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to visualize medals won per country/athlete, age group, average height, average weight, and average age
