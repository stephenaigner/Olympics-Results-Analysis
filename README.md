# Olympics-Results-Analysis
### Description:
* This project was an analysis of 120 years of Olympic games results (1896 - 2016)
* The data was sourced from a public site: [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)
* I created a database and tables with PostgreSQL, imported the CSV files, and then performed various queries for analyisis (See Below)
* I developed a Tableau dashboard [Linked Here](https://public.tableau.com/views/OlympicGames120Years/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) to visualize medals won per country, athlete, and age group. The box plots display the distribution of each sport's average height, weight, and age. I created filters for year, sport, country, season, and sex.
